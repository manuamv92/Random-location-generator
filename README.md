# Random-location-generator

I am creating a small Javascript program to generate random locations for TTRPG's, the objective of this program, apart from being a portfolio practice, 
is to make it easier for the game maters to improvise locations without rolling a hundred dice or inventing them by the way.   

For this first version, I am going to just use the tables included in Forbidden Lands Gamemaster's guide, and I am going to focus on villages, castles and dungeons, 
I am going to adapt the content of the tables to make the program compatible with every fantasy RPG and that's it, there is going to be a main function 
with one variable (Village, Castle or Dungeon), and the rest will be automated.   

If someone gets interested in this project and wants to edit the code in 
any way they want, add UI or make it into a webpage, add more variables or even enlarge the tables or add new ones, feel completely free to do it, this 
program is free to use for anyone who wants to use it in any way, just give me some credit if you want to, as I am still learning to code and I would love 
to work coding some day.
